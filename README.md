#James Shen Eventbrite Coding Challenge!

This simple web app demos using the Eventbrite API along with the Google Maps API to create an event finder. Using a prefetched
list of Eventrbite event categories, the app fetches a list of relevant events within the bounding box of the google map. 
By clicking the 'locate' icons for a given event, one can pinpoint its location on the map if they are interested, and read further
into the description of the event provided.

Additionally, a button allows the user to toggle between finding free and all events.

Built on Backbone.js, using Bootstrap for CSS, using the Eventbrite and Google Map APIs
